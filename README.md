# Display Take-Home

Welcome to the Display take-home interview!

Check out the [prompt](PROMPT.md) to get started.

## README Questions:

The following are some sample questions for you to get started on your README, but feel free to format it in any way you see fit.

## Describe any important assumptions that you have made in your code.


## What edge cases have you considered in your code? What edge cases have you yet to handle?


## What are some things you would like to do if you had more time?


## Is there anything you would have to change about the design of your current code to do these things? Give a rough outline of how you might implement these ideas.
